The best way to read file probably is :
for line in open('file'):
    #do things here
Benefit is, the whole file won't be loaded into memory all 

Tranditionaly way is:
for line in open('file').readlines():
    #do things here
Even though the statement says readlines, the whole file will be loaded into memory all in once
